* Ability to set the timezone name for Google Calendar, with the `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TIME_ZONE_NAME` variable. This is necessary if you're using Google's Family Calendar feature, which is hardcoded to UTC. 

## 2023-02-13
* Breaking change - the setup now runs under a Python virtual environment for safety and easy recovery. If you are updating, rerun the README instructions. 
* Localization - the time format and date format will now be formatted according to the Raspberry Pi's default locale. Usually this is `en_GB` but can be changed using `raspi-config`.  
* The font used to display the text will also be based on the Raspberry Pi's locale. Whatever `fc-match sans-serif` says is the font that gets used. The default for most Western locales is DejaVu Sans. 
* It's possible to pick another locale by setting the `LANG` environment variable in the env.sh, instructions added for that. 
* It's possible to override the font, I've added instructions for that.  But it's really basic. I don't know much about font config.
